Grammar structures of verbs

Verbs are words that indicate an action, state, or process. They can be simple or compound, regular or irregular, transitive or intransitive, active or passive, etc.

Simple verbs are verbs that are not formed by the combination of other verbs. For example, "run", "cook", "think", etc.

Compound verbs are verbs that are formed by the combination of two or more verbs. For example, "decompose", "develop", "discover", etc.

Regular verbs are verbs that follow a regular pattern when conjugated. For example, "eat" (ate, ate, ate, ate, ate, ate).

Irregular verbs are verbs that do not follow a regular pattern when conjugated. For example, "go" (went, went, went, went, went, went).

Transitive verbs are verbs that require an object to complete their meaning. For example, "eat" (ate an apple).

Intransitive verbs are verbs that do not require an object to complete their meaning. For example, "sleep" (slept).

Active verbs indicate that the subject performs the action. For example, "The dog barks".

Passive verbs indicate that the action is performed on the subject. For example, "The dog was barked at".
