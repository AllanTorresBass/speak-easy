What is the subject and predicate?

The subject and predicate are the two main parts of a sentence. The subject is the person or thing that the sentence is about. The predicate is what is being said about the subject.

How to identify the subject and predicate?

To identify the subject and predicate of a sentence, you can ask the following questions:

Who or what is the sentence about? The answer to this question is the subject.  
What is being said about the subject? The answer to this question is the predicate.  
Examples

The dog barks.  
In this sentence, the subject is "dog" because it is what the sentence is about. The predicate is "barks" because it is what is being said about the subject.

The girl eats an ice cream.  
In this sentence, the subject is "girl" because it is what the sentence is about. The predicate is "eats an ice cream" because it is what is being said about the subject.

What types of subject and predicate are there?

Subjects

Subjects can be of two types:

**Explicit subjects**: These are subjects that are expressed explicitly in the sentence. For example, in the sentence "The dog barks", the subject is "dog".

**Implicit subjects**: These are subjects that are not expressed explicitly in the sentence, but that can be inferred from the context. For example, in the sentence "It is raining", the implicit subject is "rain".

Predicates

Predicates can also be of two types:

**Verbal predicates**: These are predicates that are formed with a verb. For example, in the sentence "The dog barks", the predicate is "barks".  
**Nominal predicates**: These are predicates that are formed with a noun or an adjective. For example, in the sentence "The girl is beautiful", the predicate is "beautiful".

Exercises

To practice using the subject and predicate, you can do the following exercises:

The house is big.
